# BiomeBonanza
A World-Expanding Minecraft Mod.

This Is Biome Bonanza, a mod for the popular 3D survival game Minecraft. But you've already gathered that, haven't you? Maybe you have, maybe you haven't. Either way, here's the deal.

# Our Goals

What Biome Bonanza aims to achieve is a level of perfection most Minecraft modding projects don't achieve, Biome Bonanza want's to feel like it could be an official update. And not just how the textures look like most may strive for. We want it to feel like something mojang could've made, even in it's imperfections. Because that's what makes minecraft so fun. It's simple, complicated, and imperfect. This is how Biome Bonanza what's to feel.
