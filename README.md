# Biome Bonanza
*A World-Expanding Minecraft Mod.*

**This Project is Currently Placed on Hold!** *(Sadly the main, and only, pc we currently use for code editing is out of space, so we can't re-install gradle. Sorry.)*

This is *Biome Bonanza*, a mod for the popular 3D survival/sandbox game *Minecraft*. But you've already gathered that, haven't you? Maybe you have, maybe you haven't. Either way, **here's the deal.**

## Our Goals

What *Biome Bonanza* aims to achieve is a level of perfection most Minecraft modding projects *don't* achieve, Biome Bonanza wants to feel like it could be an *official update*, and **not just how the textures look**, like most may strive for. *We want it to feel like something mojang could've made*, even in its imperfections. Because that's what makes Minecraft so fun. *It's simple, complicated, and imperfect.* This is how Biome Bonanza **wants to feel.**

Feel free to leave feedback. For example, you could send an **email,** you can reach us at contacting.cubes@gmail.com *hopefully* we will see it and can improve upon your request! Another way you could is through **GitHub's "Discussions"** page on our project, if we have anything meaningful to say we will try to **reply as soon as we can.** We are working on getting more ways for you to get in touch with our team, but for now there are only a few. *Sorry.*
